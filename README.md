# Policy Optimization for Financial Decision-Making

This project analyzes the **LendingClub loan dataset** to compare two modeling approaches for loan approval:

1. **Supervised Deep Learning Model (MLP):** Predicts the *probability* of default.  
2. **Offline Reinforcement Learning Agent (CQL):** Learns a *policy* to maximize financial return.

The analysis is based on the core project requirements, including:
- A rigorous, **time-based data split** to prevent leakage.  
- A comparison of **predictive (AUC/F1)** vs. **decision-making (Estimated Policy Value)** metrics.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is divided into four main tasks, contained in separate Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` files).  
**They must be run in order.**

- `task_1_preprocessing.ipynb`:  
  Loads the raw data, performs cleaning, feature engineering (using pre-loan data only), and a time-based split.  
  ➤ Saves processed datasets to the `data/` directory.

- `task_2_mlp.ipynb`:  
  Loads the processed data, builds, trains, and evaluates a TensorFlow/Keras MLP classifier.  
  ➤ Saves the trained model to the `models/` directory.

- `task_3_cql.ipynb`:  
  Loads the processed data, frames the problem for offline RL, engineers rewards from post-loan outcomes, and trains a `d3rlpy` Discrete CQL agent.  
  ➤ Saves the agent to the `models/` directory.

- `task_4_analysis.ipynb`:  
  Loads the trained models and test data, runs a final comparison, and prints the analysis of both predictive accuracy (AUC/F1) and estimated policy value ($).
